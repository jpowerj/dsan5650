**Welcome to DSAN 5650: Causal Inference for Computational Social Science at Georgetown University!**

## Course Description

This course provides students with the opportunity to take the analytical skills, machine learning algorithms, and statistical methods learned throughout their first year in the program and explore how they can be employed towards carrying out rigorous, original research in the behavioral and social sciences. With a particular emphasis on tackling the additional challenges which arise when moving from associational to causal inference, particularly when only observational (as opposed to experimental) data is available, students will become proficient in cutting-edge causal Machine Learning techniques such as propensity score matching, synthetic controls, causal program evaluation, inverse social welfare function estimation from panel data, and Double-Debiased Machine Learning.

In-class examples will cover continuous, discrete-choice, and textual data from a wide swath of social and behavioral sciences: economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, quantitative history, and digital humanities. After gaining experience through in-class labs and homework assignments focused on reproducing key findings from recent journal articles in each of these disciplines, students will spend the final weeks of the course on a final project demonstrating their ability to develop, evaluate, and test the robustness of a causal hypothesis.

*Prerequisites: DSAN 5000, DSAN 5100 (DSAN 5300 recommended but not required)*

## Course Overview

The course revolves around three "pillars", which we'll examine individually before bringing them together for your final projects at the end of the class: high-level ethical issues in data science, general ethical frameworks, and public policy applications.

### Data Science

A portion of the course will focus on introductions to cutting-edge technologies like self-driving cars, ChatGPT, facial detection algorithms, and various applications of AI to police and military technologies. For this portion, we'll draw fairly often from the contents of the following books:

* @perez_invisible_2019: *Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men*.
* Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein (2020). <i><a href='https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/' target='_blank'>Data Feminism</a></i>. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. [Free, open-source!]
* Cathy O'Neil (2016). *[Weapons of Math Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction)*. New York, NY: Crown Books.

Since there are plenty of in-depth resources available to you (e.g., other Georgetown courses!) for learning the *technical details* of these technologies, our goal in this course will be to learn just the particular *aspects* of each technology which are most relevant to the ethical and policy issues they present.

For example, we will look at Neural Netwok-based Machine Learning algorithms, but we will focus specifically on how the **performance** of these algorithms on a given task depends crucially on the existence of effective **training data** for that task. The breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence which have had an immense impact on society over the past few decades, for example, have **not** come about because of new algorithms (neural networks, for example, have been around since the 1950s). Rather, they have come about because of the massive, exponential increase in the amount of **data** available to **train** these already-existing algorithms: for example, data scraped from across the entire web, or from millions of scanned books, or from Wikipedia's massive collection of articles. This means, therefore, that these algorithms simply **encode** pre-existing human biases into algorithmically-derived "rules", thus motivating the next pillar of the course: Ethics!

### Ethics

For the ethics-focused portion of the course, we'll be reading selections from the following textbook:

* Lewis Vaughn and Louis P. Pojman (2021). <i><a href='https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/the-moral-life-9780197610060?cc=us&lang=en&' target='_blank'>The Moral Life: An Introductory Reader in Ethics and Literature</a></i>. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. [<a href='https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/edx5t4xedli9pcfxm3330/Louis-P.-Pojman-The-Moral-Life_-An-Introductory-Reader-in-Ethics-and-Literature.pdf?rlkey=6pwuvdfed6m8mzp3d0l5rsajv&dl=1' target='_blank'>PDF</a>]

From the vast array of readings contained in this collection, we'll look at both "standard" ethical readings from e.g. Jeremy Bentham and Immanuel Kant plus readings from literary sources like Ursula Le Guin and Ambrose Bierce.

### Public Policy

For the final piece of the course we will take the **technological developments** discussed the first portion, analyze them using the **ethical frameworks** discussed in the second portion, and come to **conclusions** as to what types of things lawmakers, governments, and civil society organizations (NGOs, for example, and Think Tanks) can do **in practice** to address the ethical issues raised by these technologies. This means that, specifically, the recommended final project for the course will be a **Policy Whitepaper**, where you will choose a particular institution and make a **recommendation** to them in terms of how they can use their power (for example, the power to pass laws) to most effectively address an ethical issue that you believe is important.

For this portion of the class we'll have to draw on a wide range of different readings, depending on what particular subdomains of public policy are most interesting to you all, but as a general textbook on ethics in data science which does focus a good amount on **policy** specifically, we will look at:

* Anne L. Washington (2023). <i><a href=' https://annewashington.com/book-ethical-data-science-prediction-in-the-public-interest/' target='_blank'>Ethical Data Science: Prediction in the Public Interest</a></i>. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.

Now that you have an overview of the trajectory of the course, the following section contains the particulars of what we'll be reading and working on each week!

## Schedule

The following is a rough map of what we will work through together throughout the semester; given that **everyone learns at a different pace**, my aim is to leave us with a good amount of **flexibility** in terms of how much time we spend on each topic: if I find that it takes me longer than a week to convey a certain topic in sufficient depth, for example, then I view it as a strength rather than a weakness of the course that we can then rearrange the calendar below by adding an extra week on that particular topic! Similarly, if it seems like I am spending too much time on a topic, to the point that students seem bored or impatient to move onto the next topic, we can move a topic intended for the next week to the current week!

### Homework Lateness Policy

After the due date, for each **homework** assignment, you will have a grace period of 24 hours to submit the assignment without a lateness penalty. After this 24-hour grace period, late penalties will be applied based on the following scale (unless you obtain an excused lateness from one of the instructional staff!):

* 0 to 24 hours late: no penalty
* 24 to 30 hours late: 2.5% penalty
* 30 to 42 hours late: 5% penalty
* 42 to 54 hours late: 10% penalty
* 54 to 66 hours late: 20% penalty
* More than 66 hours late: Assignment submissions no longer accepted (without instructor approval)
