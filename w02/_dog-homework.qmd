## My Dog Ate My Homework {.smaller}

* The issue: for some students $h_i$ is **missing**, since **their dog ate their homework**
* Let $D = \begin{cases}1 &\text{if dog ate homework} \\ 0 &\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$
* This means we don't observe $H$ but $H^* = \begin{cases} H &\text{if }D = 0 \\ \texttt{NA} &\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$
* In the **easy case**, let's say that dogs eat homework **at random** (i.e., without reference to $S$ or $H$). Then we say $H$ is "missing at random".  Our PGM now looks like:

Dogs eat homework because their owner studied so much that the dog got ignored?

Dogs hate sloppy work, and eat bad homework that would have gotten a low score

::: {#dog-noisy}

Noisy homes ($Z = 1$) cause dogs to get agitated and eat homework more often, **and** students do worse
