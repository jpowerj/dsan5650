## Core Textbooks

* Morgan and Winship, *Counterfactuals and Causal Inference: Methods and Principles for Social Research* [@morgan_counterfactuals_2015] \[[PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rmuw9yw0gflg9wprufzu4/Counterfactuals-and-Causal-Inference.pdf?rlkey=gpzpuqgmzgsdwo18j22pl6yiw&dl=1)\]
    * The book which comes closest to being an all-encompassing, single textbook for the class. It brings together different "strands" of causal modeling research (since each field---economics, bioinformatics, sociology, etc.---tends to use its own notation and vocabulary), unifying them into a single approach. The only reason we can't use it as *the* main textbook is because it hasn't been updated since 2015, and most of the assignments in this class use computational tools from 2018 onwards!
* Angrist and Pischke, *Mastering 'Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect* [@angrist_mastering_2014] \[[PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/3xa9tfswmv1w8ez54prtk/Joshua-D.-Angrist-J-rn-Steffen-Pischke-Mastering-Metrics.pdf?rlkey=2w0ipphrgxrejd7ddkv1wd635&dl=1)\]
    * This book is included as the second of the three "core" texts mainly because, it uses the language of causality specific to Econometrics, the language that is most familiar to me from my PhD training in Political Economy. However, if you tend to learn better by example, it also does a good job of foregrounding specific examples (like evaluating charter schools and community policing policies), so that the methods emerging naturally from attempts to solve these puzzles when association methods like linear regression fail to capture their causal linkages.
* Pearl and Mackenzie, *The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect* [@pearl_book_2018] \[[EPUB](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0r7kg7hwibztvfnby8vdg/The-Book-of-Why.epub?rlkey=czdiw5mku5uamjdiwyyzlpmdr&dl=1)\]
    * This book contrasts with the Angrist and Pischke book in using the language of causality formed within *Computer Science* rather than Economics. It can be a good starting point especially if you're unfamiliar with the heavy use of *diagrams* for scientific modeling---basically, whereas Angrist and Pischke's first instinct is to use (sometimes informal) *equations* like $y = mx + b$ to explain steps in the procedures, Pearl and Mackenzie's instinct would be to instead use something like $\require{enclose}\enclose{circle}{\kern .01em ~x~\kern .01em} \overset{\small m, b}{\longrightarrow} \enclose{circle}{\kern.01em y~\kern .01em}$ to represent the same concept (in this case, a line with slope $m$ and intercept $b$!).
