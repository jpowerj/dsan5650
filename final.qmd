## Overview

Our goal is to make the final project as open-ended as possible, to give you the space to explore any particular topic that may have piqued your interest throughout the semester! At the same time, we hope to provide you with guidance and mentorship so that you don't feel lost as to how to start, how to proceed, and/or what to submit for the final deliverable![^montessori]
