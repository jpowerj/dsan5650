* Quanty things, but then PhD major was **Political Philosophy** (concentration in **International Relations**)
* What most interested me: <a href='https://unravelhistory.com/' target='_blank'>**unraveling history**</a>; Easy to get lost in "present-day" details of e.g. **debiasing** algorithms and **fairness in AI**, but these questions go back literally thousands of years!
* Pol philosophers distinguish "ancients" and "moderns" based on a crucial **shift in perspective**: ancients sought perfection, while @rousseau_social_1762 "took men [sic] as they are, and laws as they could be".

# Motivation II: Causal Inference {data-stack-name="Causal Inference"}

## Data-Generating Processes (DGPs)

The fundamental building block for the course is the idea of a **Data-Generating Process (DGP)**. You may have encountered this concept in passing during other DSAN courses (for example, in DSAN 5100, a phrase like "Assume $X$ is drawn i.i.d. from a Normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$" is a statement characterizing the DGP of a Random Variable $X$), but in this course we will "zoom in" on this concept rather than treating it like a black box or a footnote to e.g. a theorem like the Law of Large Numbers.

This deep dive into DGPs is necessary for us here, since our goal in the course is **to move from *associational* statements** like "an increase of $X$ by one unit is associated with an increase of $Y$ by $\beta$ units" to ***causal* statements** like "increasing $X$ by one unit *causes* $Y$ to increase by $\beta$ units". As you'll see in Week 1, the tools from probability theory and statistics that you learned in DSAN 5100---Random Variables, Cumulative Distribution Functions, Conditional Probability, and so on---are necessary but **not *sufficient*** to analyze data from a causal perspective.

For example, if we use our tools from DSAN 5000 and DSAN 5100 on some dataset to discover that:

* The probability that some event $E_1$ occurs is $\Pr(E_1) = 0.5$, and
* The probability that $E_1$ occurs **conditional on** another event $E_0$ occurring is $\Pr(E_1 \mid E_0) = 0.75$,

we unfortunately cannot infer from these two pieces of information that the occurrence of $E_0$ **causes** an increase in the likelihood of $E_1$ occurring.

This issue (that **conditional probabilities** could not be interpreted causally) at first represented a kind of dead end for scientists interested in employing probability theory to study causal relationships... In recent decades, however, researchers have built up what amounts to an additional "layer" of modeling tools which augment the existing machinery of probability theory to address causality head-on!^[@pearl_causality_2000 represents a key work in this field of research, as it essentially brought together different pieces of causal models into one unified, rigorous framework.]

For instance, a modeling approach called **"$\textsf{do}$-Calculus"**, that we will learn in this class, *extends* the core operations and definitions of probability theory to allow such an move to deriving causality! It does this by introducing a $\textsf{do}(\cdot)$ operator that can be applied to Random Variables like $X$, with e.g. $\textsf{do}(X = 5)$ representing the event wherein someone has **intervened** in a **Data-Generating Process** to **force** the value of $X$ to be 5.

With this operator in hand (that is, used alongside an explicit model of a DGP satisfying a set of underlying axioms which are slightly more strict than the axioms of probability theory), it turns out that we *can* make causal inferences using a very similar pair of facts! If we know that:

* The probability that some event $E_1$ occurs is $\Pr(E_1) = 0.5$, and
* The probability that $E_1$ occurs **conditional on** the event $\textsf{do}(E_0)$ occurring is $\Pr(E_1 \mid \textsf{do}(E_0)) = 0.75$,

**now** we can actually draw the inference that the occurrence of $E_0$ **caused** an increase in the likelihood of $E_1$ occurring!

This stylized comparison (between what's possible using "core" probability theory and what's possible when we augment it with additional causal modeling tools) serves as our basic motivation for the course, so that from Week 2 onwards we build upon this foundation to reach the three learning goals described in the next section!
