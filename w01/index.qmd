* Quanty things, but then PhD major was **Political Philosophy** (concentration in **International Relations**)
* What most interested me: <a href='https://unravelhistory.com/' target='_blank'>**unraveling history**</a>; Easy to get lost in "present-day" details of e.g. **debiasing** algorithms and **fairness in AI**, but these questions go back literally thousands of years!
* Pol philosophers distinguish "ancients" and "moderns" based on a crucial **shift in perspective**: ancients sought perfection, while @rousseau_social_1762 "took men [sic] as they are, and laws as they could be".

* 2015-present: Teach CS + design thinking in refugee camps in West Bank and Gaza each summer (Code for Palestine)
* Metaethics: Learn about the world, challenge+update prior beliefs (Bayes' rule!); I hope to challenge+update them throughout semester, with your help 🙂

* "Philosophers have hitherto only tried to *understand* the world; the point, however, is to *change* it." [@marx_thesen_1845]
* Dialectical implication: the more we understand it the better we'll be at changing it

# Ethics as an Axiomatic System {data-stack-name="Axioms" .crunch-title .crunch-figcaption .crunch-images}

## Axiomatics {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-images .crunch-figcaption .crunch-quarto-layout-panel .crunch-quarto-figure}

::: {layout="[1,1]" layout-valign="top"}

::: {#axioms-text}

<!-- * In the field of math before the 20th century (and in our general understanding of math today), math was (is) a domain dealing with **truths**
* Thanks to figures like Georg Cantor, David Hilbert, and especially Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead, mathematicians no longer believe that theorems of mathematics are "true" in an **absolute sense** -->

* *Popular understanding of math*: Deals with **Facts**, statements are **true** or **false**
  * Ex: $1 + 1 = 2$ is "true"
* *Reality*: No statements in math are **absolutely true!** Only **conditional statements** are possible to prove!
* We cannot prove **atomic** statements $q$, only implicational statements: $p \implies q$ for some **axiom(s)** $p$.
  * $1 + 1 = 2$ is **indeterminate** without definitions of $1$, $+$, $=$, and $2$!
  * (Easy counterexample for math/CS majors: $1 + 1 = 0$ in $\mathbb{Z}_2$)


<!-- * That is: mathematicians today recognize that **we cannot prove non-implicational statements**! We will never be able to prove an (atomic) statement $q$, only implicational statements: $p \implies q$ for some **axiom(s)** $q$. -->

::: {layout="[1,1]" layout-valign="center"}

::: {#one-one-text}

* How it's taught: this is a **rule**, and if you **don't follow it** you will be **banished to eternal hellfire**
* How it's proved: $ZFC \implies [1 + 1 = 2]$, where $ZFC$ stands for the **<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory' target='_blank'>Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms with the Axiom of Choice</a>!**

## Proving $1 + 1 = 2$ {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-p .math-09}

*(A non-formal proof that still captures the gist:)*

* Axiom 1: There is a type of thing that can hold other things, which we'll call a **set**. We'll represent it like: $\{ \langle \text{\textit{stuff in the set}} \rangle \}$.
* Axiom 2: Start with the set with **nothing** in it, $\{\}$, and call it "$0$".
* Axiom 3: If we put this set $0$ **inside of** an empty set, we get a new set $\{0\} = \{\{\}\}$, which we'll call "$1$".
* Axiom 4: If we put this set $1$ **inside of** another set, we get another new set $\{1\} = \{\{\{\}\}\}$, which we'll call "$2$".
* Axiom 5: This operation (creating a "next number" by placing a given number inside an empty set) we'll call **succession**: $S(x) = \{x\}$
* Axiom 6: We'll define **addition**, $a + b$, as applying this **succession** operation $S$ to $a$, $b$ times. Thus $a + b = \underbrace{S(S(\cdots (S(}_{b\text{ times}}a))\cdots ))$
* Result: (Axioms 1-6) $\implies 1 + 1 = S(1) = S(\{\{\}\}) = \{\{\{\}\}\} = 2. \; \blacksquare$ 

## How Is This Relevant to Ethics? {.smaller .crunch-math-3 .crunch-ul .crunch-li-4 .crunch-title .crunch-p}

*(Thank you for bearing with me on that 😅)*

* Just as mathematicians slowly came to the realization that

$$
\textbf{mathematical results} \neq \textbf{(non-implicational) truths}
$$

* I hope to help you see how

$$
\textbf{ethical conclusions} \neq \textbf{(non-implicational) truths}
$$

* When someone says $1 + 1 = 2$, you are allowed to **question them**, and ask, **"On what basis? Please explain..."**.
  * Here the only valid answer is a **collection of axioms** which **entail** $1 + 1 = 2$
* When someone says **Israel has the right to defend itself**, you are allowed to **question them**, and ask, **"On what basis? Please explain..."**
  * Here the only valid answer is an **ethical framework** which **entails** that **Israel has the right to defend itself**.

## Axiomatic Systems: Statements Can Be True *And* False {.smaller .title-10 .crunch-quarto-layout-panel .crunch-title .crunch-ul}

* Let $T$ be the sum of the interior angles of a triangle. We're taught $T = 180^\circ$ is a "rule"
* **Euclid's Fifth Postulate** $P_5$: Given a line and a point not on it, exactly one line parallel to the given line can be drawn through the point.

<!-- Technically, when phrased in this way, this axiom is called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair%27s_axiom' target='_blank'>Playfair's Axiom</a>. But it is **logically equivalent** to Euclid's Fifth Postulate! -->

## Ethical Systems: Promise-Keeping {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-quarto-layout-panel .crunch-ul .title-12}

* Scenario: You just baked a pie, and you promised your friend you'd give them the pie. You're walking over to the friend's house to give them the pie.
* Suddenly, you turn the corner to encounter a hostage situation: the hostage-taker is going to kill their hostage unless someone gives them a pie in the next 30 seconds
* Do you give the hostage-taker the pie?

::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#conseqentialism}

<center>
**Consequentialist Ethics $\implies$ Yes**
</center>

* To be ethical is to weigh consequences of your actions
* The **positive consequences** of giving the pie to the hostage-taker (saving a life) outweigh the **negative consequences** (breaking your promise to your friend)
* *(Ex: **Utilitarianism**, associated with British philosopher **Jeremy Bentham**)*

:::
::: {#deontology}

<center>
**Deontological Ethics $\implies$ No**
</center>

* To be ethical is to live by rules which you would **want everyone to follow**.
* As a **rule** (a "categorical imperative"), you **must not break promises**. (Breaking this rule $\implies$ others can also "pick and choose" when to honor promises to you)
* *(Ex: **Kantian Ethics**, associated with German philosopher **Immanuel Kant**)*

## ...There is Still Hope! I Promise! {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-blockquote .crunch-li-8}

* Fair Comparison through **Statistical Matching**:
* @lyall_divided_2020: "Treating certain ethnic groups as second-class citizens [...] leads victimized soldiers to subvert military authorities once war begins. The higher an army's inequality, the greater its rates of desertion, side-switching, and casualties"

> Matching constructs **pairs of belligerents** that are **similar** across a wide range of traits thought to dictate battlefield performance but that **vary** in levels of prewar inequality. The more similar the belligerents, the better our estimate of inequality's effects, as all other traits are shared and thus cannot explain observed differences in performance, helping assess how battlefield performance **would have** improved (declined) if the belligerent had a lower (higher) level of prewar inequality.
> 
> Since [non-matched] cases are **dropped** [...] selected cases are more representative of average belligerents/wars than outliers with few or no matches, [providing] surer ground for testing generalizability of the book's claims than focusing solely on canonical but unrepresentative usual suspects (Germany, the United States, Israel)
