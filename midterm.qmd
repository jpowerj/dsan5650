## Overview

The DSAN 5650 in-class midterm will start at **6:30pm EDT on Wednesday, July 2nd**. It is intended to take only 1.5 hours, but you will have 3 hours to take it just in case, so that it will be due by **9:30pm EDT**.

We've covered a lot of... sometimes-disjointed topics thus far, so our goal for the midterm is to emphasize the most important takeaways from across the first six weeks of the class, by putting them in your brain's short-term memory **one more time** before we dive into the second, computationally-focused half of the course when you come back from July 4th weekend! As a reminder, there is a very good reason to continually try and **re-remember** the same course topics, coming from studies of long-term memory retention:
